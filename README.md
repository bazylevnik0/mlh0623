Polylogic

Inspiration
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_operations_on_polygons

What it does
you can choose colors for two polygons and apply for them boolean logic

How we built it
react with canvas element, hosted on codesandbox with version control to github.

polygons are stored in own matrixes, the general matrix for drawing is storing pointers for these polygons( objects in javascript can be used for it, when you store objects, their values can be like a adresses). it is very simple implementation(just analyzing general matrix for drawing) but i think it can be very interesting to use some operations with polygons objects... because the common function for drawing(reading "pointers") can handle changes in objects(polygon's matrixes)... i mean maybe in future it will be interesting, now i go to sleep hehe
